# YOLO Model

This repository contains sample code for YOLOv5, utilizing a sample surgical dataset from Kaggle, which is thoroughly documented within the code.

## How to Improve the YOLO Model

1. **Different Versions of YOLO**
2. **Adding More Images to the Dataset (Data Augmentation)**
3. **Loading Different Pre-trained Weights for Similar Datasets**
4. **Modifying Hyperparameters in the .yaml File**
5. **Utilizing the Largest Batch Size Possible**

**Resources for Model Improvement:**
- [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gDZ2xcTOgR39tGGs-EZ6i3RTs16wmzZQ)
- [Ultralytics YOLOv5 Documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/yolov5/tutorials/tips_for_best_training_results/#training-settings)

## Notes for Sample_Code.ipynb

- Ensure to modify the paths for the dataset as they differ from the tutorial.
- Adjust the YAML file to include the updated paths for the dataset (should be in the "/content/YOLOv5(fixed)-1" folder, visible in the file explorer on the side).
